# genetic_mapping_with_ASMap
A script helping to create a genetic map using package ASMap in R.

Author: Luzie U. Wingen, John Innes Centre, UK; date: 06/12/2021

Software: R 4.0, library ASMap

Basic instructions:

Unzip folder "genetic_mapping_ASMap_2021.zip" and change into the newly created directory "genetic_mapping_ASMap_2021". Open the file "ASMap_script.R" in the R software environment (https://cran.r-project.org/) using a suitable graphical user interface, e.g. Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and follow the script line by line - using the provided test data in the data directory. Individual steps are commented in the script to explain their function.

Additionally, there is a short pdf tutorial for more details: "short_tutorial_genetic_mapping_with_ASMap_in_R.pdf"

Once the test data set (data/PxW141 KASP data.csv) has been successfully mapped, the user can bring their genotype data into the right format and adjust the script so that it will work on that data set.
