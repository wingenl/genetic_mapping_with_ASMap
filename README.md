Software: R 4.0, library ASMap

Basic instructions:

Open the file "ASMap_script.R" in the R software environment (https://cran.r-project.org/) using a suitable graphical user interface, e.g. Rstudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and follow the script line by line - using the provided test data in the data directory. Individual steps are commented in the script to explain their function.

Additionally, there is a short pdf tutorial for more details: "short_tutorial_genetic_mapping_with_ASMap_in_R.pdf"

Once the test data set has been successfully mapped, the user can bring their genotype data into the right format and
adjust the script so that it will work on that data set.
